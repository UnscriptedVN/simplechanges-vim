# Simple Changes for Vim

The following package provides syntax highlighting support for the Simple Changes format to Vim and Vim-based products such as NeoVim and MacVim.

## Get started

If you have `vim-plug`, you can add the following line to your `.vimrc` in the `call#plug()` block:

```
Plug 'UnscriptedVN/simplechanges-vim'
```

Reload your Vim settings with `:source $MYVIMRC` and then run `PlugInstall` to install the plugin.
